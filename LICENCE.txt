CITIZEN DJ – GUIDE TO COPYRIGHT & ETHICS
Library of Congress
==================================================

Citizen DJ is officially open to the public and all sounds on this website
are completely free-to-use for your remixing needs.

--------------------------------------------------
A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE LAW AND ETHICS OF THE DIGITAL
SAMPLING OF RECORDED SOUND MATERIALS
--------------------------------------------------

This guide is made for anyone who is interested in making music by
sampling existing audio and video material from the Library of Congress
and beyond. It is designed to be accessible and clear while not
over-simplifying what is a complex set of copyright and ethical issues.

This is not meant to be legal advice, but a guide that aggregates,
references, organizes, and summarizes existing information from
reputable sources such as the Library of Congress and the U.S.
Copyright Office.

This guide is built on top of the Library’s Understanding Copyright
guide, with a special focus on audiovisual materials and music
production. It is recommended that you read the Library’s guide as an
introduction to copyright.

--------------------------------------------------
COPYRIGHT STATUS OF AUDIO ON CITIZEN DJ
--------------------------------------------------

All audio found on the Citizen DJ website is free to use from a copyright
perspective. Each audio item should contain a statement explaining how
and why it is free to use.

This guide also discusses audio materials that may be found outside of
Citizen DJ, including materials on the main Library of Congress website
and other sources. Ethical considerations of digital sampling apply to
all audio materials, including those found on Citizen DJ.

--------------------------------------------------
COPYRIGHT CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------

To use a sound recording without permission, you must consider the
copyright status of:

1. The sound recording itself
2. The underlying composition or text (such as song composition or
   lyrics)

--------------------------------------------------
SOUND RECORDING CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------

A sound recording may be used freely if one or more of the following
conditions are met:

1. The recording was made by U.S. Government employees as part of their
   official duties (U.S. Copyright Law, Section 105).
2. The recording was made by U.S. Government employees and includes
   signed releases from non-employee performers.
3. The recording was dedicated to the public domain by the rights holder.
4. The recording was released under a license permitting adaptation and
   commercial use (e.g., Creative Commons Attribution).
5. Explicit permission has been obtained from the copyright holder.
6. As of January 1, 2022, the recording was published in the United
   States 100 years ago or more (Music Modernization Act, Section 1401).

--------------------------------------------------
UNDERLYING COMPOSITION CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------

An underlying composition may be used freely if one or more of the
following conditions are met:

1. The work was published 95 years ago or more.
2. The work was unpublished and the author died 70 years ago or more.
3. The work was unpublished, the author’s death date is unknown, and the
   work was created 120 years ago or more.
4. The work was created by U.S. Government employees as part of their
   official duties (Section 105).
5. The work was commissioned by the U.S. Government and the non-employee
   author did not claim copyright.
6. The work was dedicated to the public domain by the rights holder.
7. The work was released under a license permitting adaptation and
   commercial use (e.g., Creative Commons Attribution).
8. Explicit permission has been obtained from the copyright holder.

--------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------

There are many exceptions and special cases beyond the criteria listed
above. For more detailed information, users should consult official
copyright term tables and authoritative legal resources.

If the Library of Congress clearly states that an item is in the public
domain in its “Rights & Access” section, that determination can be
considered authoritative.

Items labeled “no known copyright restrictions” are less explicit than
“public domain,” but the risk of copyright issues is generally low.

Fair use considerations may apply in some cases, but fair use does not
guarantee protection.

--------------------------------------------------
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Even when audio materials are legally free to use, creators are
encouraged to consider ethical factors such as attribution, cultural
context, representation, and respect for original creators and
communities.
